Try to earn more "Sharity©oins" & donate money to Charity

"Sharitycoins" was created by Kristian Petersén 2014-10-31 & is thought to become a global welfare program. Users will have their social network accounts as a base & tool to market our good intentions globally.

The idéa is that our members can recruit new users to or system and will earn coins for their contribution. The coins are stored in our system and can be used both to donate directly to a good cause, and / or help them to grow stonger in our games.

I like the quote: "This is not our world, we have only borrowed it from our children." 
Welcome to join us in our struggle for a better world that our children will one day inherit from us.

Thanks in advance! 
Best regards 
//Team SharityCoin
